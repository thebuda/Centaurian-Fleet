Description: “Hook” file for PyInstaller
        ==================================
        
        This package includes the “hook” files extending PyInstaller to adapt it to
        the special needs and methods used by a Python package.
        
        PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single
        package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python
        interpreter or any modules.
